# Monitoring Conference & Hackathon

## Dates

* 19. bis 20. September 2013

## Venue

* Berlin, Germany

## Format

Single-track series of talks during the first half of each day. After lunch, resume a dual-track of workshops and hackathon. The goal being that the talks will motivate attendees to hack and investigate monitoring tools for themselves. For attendees that require further instruction in particular domains we will offer workshops with open source project leaders and subject matter experts. Optionally, attendees can dive right into the hackathon and work on pre-determined issues (or their own self-guided track) with a goal to present their results during a series of lightning talks (and hopefully, awards) at the end of the conference.
